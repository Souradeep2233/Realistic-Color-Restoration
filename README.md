* `ColorizeTrainingStableLargeBatch.ipynb`: Notebook experimenting with large batch sizes for stable training.
* `ImageColorizerColab.ipynb`: Colab-compatible notebook for image colorization.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* Python
* Jupyter Notebook
* PyTorch
* NumPy
* Matplotlib

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

* Python 3.6 or higher
* pip

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Souradeep2233/Realistic-Color-Restoration.git
cd Realistic-Color-Restoration
```

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. **Install the required packages:**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

*Note: If `requirements.txt` is not present, manually install the necessary packages:*

```bash
pip install torch torchvision numpy matplotlib
```

## 📊 Usage

1. **Open Jupyter Notebook:**

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

2. **Navigate to the desired notebook:**

Open any of the notebooks listed above to explore different colorization techniques.

*Note: Ensure that the necessary datasets are available in the appropriate directories as expected by the notebooks.*
